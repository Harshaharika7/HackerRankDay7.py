# 🚀 Day 7: Arrays | 30 Days of Code – HackerRank

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given an array, **A**, of **N** integers, print each element in **reverse order** as a single line of space-separated numbers.

## 🔡 Input Format

- First line: an integer **N** – the size of the array
    
- Second line: **N** space-separated integers representing the array elements


## ✅ Constraints

- 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
  
- 1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10000


## 📤 Output Format

Print the elements of array **A** in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

## 💻 Sample Input

4

1 4 3 2
